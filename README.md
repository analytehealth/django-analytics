django-analytics
================

Django app to capture, track and display site analytics

Install
-------
pip install dj-analytics

Add to django configuration (before 1.7)
---------------------------
* Add `djanalytics` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py file.
* Run `manage.py migrate djanalytics` to create database tables.

Add to django configuration (1.7+)
---------------------------
* Add `djanalytics` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py file.
* Point at correct migration module:

    MIGRATION_MODULES = {
        'djanalytics': 'djanalytics.django_migrations'
    }

* Run `manage.py migrate djanalytics` to create database tables.

Configure
---------
* Create and configure at least one Client and Domain.
* If you're capturing using HTML, in your urls.py, include djanalytics urls. For example:

    urlpatterns += patterns(
        '',
        (r'', include('djanalytics.urls'))
    )

* For charts, include the charts urls:

    urlpatterns += patterns('', (r'^analytics/', include='djanalytics.charts.urls'))

* For reports, include the reports urls:

    urlpatterns += patterns('', (r'^analytics/', include='djanalytics.reports.urls'))

Capture using middleware
--------------

* In settings.py, add 'djanalytics.middleware.AnalyticsMiddleware' to the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES setting
for your django project.
* In settings.py, add DJA_CLIENT_ID='[uuid of Client created above]'

Capture using HTML
------------------

    <script>
    var img_html = '<img src="http://dja_server.example.com/capture/' +
        '?dja_id=[client uuid]' +
        '&pth=' + escape(window.location.pathname) +
        '&qs=' + escape(window.location.search.substr(window.location.search.indexOf('?')+1)) +
        '&rf=' + escape(document.referrer) +
        '&sw=' + screen.width +
        '&sh=' + screen.height +
        '" style="position:absolute; left: -999px"></img>";
    document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].innerHTML += img_html;
    </script>

Capture Cross-Domain
--------------------
If you're hosting your djanalytics instance in a different domain than the site you're capturing,
you will need to use a slightly different mechanism. Set up djanalytics on your server, and ensure
it's got a url for the djanalytics_js view (included in the urls.py file). Then put the following
HTML in your templates:

    <div id="dja_tag"></div>
    <script defer="defer">
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    script.type = 'text/javascript';
    script.src = 'https://dja_server.example.com/djanalytics.js' +
                 '?dja_id=[client uuid]';
    document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].appendChild(script);
    </script>

If you want to maintain tracking ids across domains, you'll need to add them to links between sites.
If the site you're linking to is a django site with djanalytics installed, you can use the
cross-domain middleware by adding 'djanalytics.middleware.CrossDomainMiddleware' to your
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES setting and then pass the client ID, user ID and tracking ID (dja_id, dja_uuid,
and dja_tracking_id respectively) in your link as parameters. This will then handle setting the
appropriate cookies.

Filtering IP addresses
----------------------

If you're using the django admin app, djanalytics will automatically register its models. To filter
by IP address, add a new IPFilter for your client. The IPFilter uses netmasks to filter addresses. You
can also specify whether to include or exclude the given netmask. If you choose include, only IP
addresses that match the netmask will be allowed in.

Filtering Paths
---------------

The PathFilter model allows you to include or exclude path patterns. PathFilters use regex to determine
a match on the path.

Reporting
---------

### Generating report data

A management command, _collect_reporting_stats_, will generate report data. This command should
most likely be run on a schedule (cron). It takes a few arguments:

* -s, --start - Date of earliest RequestEvent to process. This is optional. If omitted, the command will
not set a beginning time when searching for RequestEvents.
* -e, --end - Date of latest RequestEvent to process. This is optional. If omitted, the command will
not set an end time when searching for RequestEvents.
* -a, --max-age - This is used when calculation visit durations as well as visit durations,
conversions and exit pages. This argument defaults to 30 days.

### Conversion Tracking

In order to track conversions, you'll need to define page patterns for the FUNNEL and CONVERSION
page types. Conversions are defined by a page visit to at least one FUNNEL page followed by
a page visit to a CONVERSION page.
